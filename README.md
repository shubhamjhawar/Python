### Python code
# Description

This Question is transversal question in which we choose all the borders and apply DFS or BFS

## My approach

My approach was to apply DFS from the borders and keep a visited array so that the regions we visited from corner should not be conquered and converted to 'X'

```
DFS Function consist of ways 
Marking it as visited
steps = [[-1,0],[1,0],[0,1],[0,-1]]
This represents up , down , right ,left direction 
We check if the steps + current cell is only in the 
right way and not in illegal cell
```
